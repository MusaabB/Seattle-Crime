# Seattle-Crime
Crime incidence in the Seattle area has increased over the past years, especially
regarding violent crimes. You will create a dashboard that communicates the results of
the spatial analysis of this type of crime this past year to provide a clear picture of the
spatial distribution of crime activity in the city. The dashboard will help decision-makers
understand the spatial patterns of crime activity and then allocate resources to address
the impacts.
